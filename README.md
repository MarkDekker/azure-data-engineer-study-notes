# Azure Data-Engineer Certification Study-notes (DP-200, DP-201)

Here is a collection of notes I made in the preparation for the Azure Data Engineering Certification. They are not exhaustive, there may be typos and incorrect info (I inferred some information). Hope it helps, but use at your own risk.

The notes are rough. They were a study tool to get everything in my noggin. Feel free to suggest improvements.
