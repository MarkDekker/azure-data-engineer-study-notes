As of May 2020 there is a reccommended learning path that is suggested for the certification. This is a great resource to get your hands dirty and get familliar with the services quickly. It is not exhaustive though! You should definitely spend a lot of time in the documentation and with the Tutorials and guides that can be found here.

It is also helpful to understand the role of other core services in the Azure Ecosystem. There will not be detailed questions on these, but there are touchpoints with data and it is useful to understand their role (Azure Functions, Azure Monitor, Azure Active Directory, Azure Cognitive Services etc.)

# DP-200

[Make sure you check out the skills outline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/exams/dp-200). I only glanced over it briefly, but it is actually very useful to go through each po int and check if you feel confident that you can complete it. There are plenty of tutorials in the Documentation.

This exam focuses more on implementation topics such as setting up services, monitoring, alerting and perfomance optimisation.

Make sure that you are fluent in setting up the respective resources (conceptually, in the portal or the CLI) and be concious of what certain more advanced features entail (Geo-Replication etc.).

# Designing DP-201

[Make sure you check out the skills outline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/certifications/exams/dp-201). I only glanced over it briefly, but it is actually very useful to go through each point and check if you feel confident that you can complete it.

 There is a lot of rich information and [architectural patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/guide/) in the documentation. Especially look at common data processing patterns such as the Lambda and Kappa architectures.

This exam focuses more on big-picture topics such as integration with other services, backups, geo-replication and security.
